This library is a wrapper for the json-glib library that aims to provide the user with a trivial alternative API to the API provided by the base json-glib library.

This is the first version of the json-me (JSON made easy) project.

This is the write-api topic branch for json-me. It aims to add a perl style autovivification interface to the json-me API in order
to also allow for the creation of new JSON data rather than just the parsing of existing JSON data.

To build jsonme, take the following steps:

 cd build

 cmake ..

 make

 make test

The last step should depend on the platform you are on. If you don't hapen to be on a amd64 ubuntu linux platform, the following step 
should be appropriate:

 sudo make install

For amd64 ubuntu linux you may alternatively run: 

  cd ..
  ./makedepstuff.sh
  dpkg -i jsonme++_0.9.0-1_amd64.deb
